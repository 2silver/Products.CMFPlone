Plone CMF Skin 0.5 - 12/3/01
Layout, Graphic Design, HTML Code and User Interface Design by Alexander Limi, Vidar Andersen and Alan Runyan. 

INSTALLATION:
* read Extensions/Install.py 
* you need CMF1.2 and Zope2.4 or higher.

COMMENTS:

 - i was thinking to provide a 'custom' edit view i would have to create a method that would get one.  obviously, on install if you wanted
to change the view of a object you could just goto the types_tool and edit the existing View action for a type.  this needs to be cleaned out

- getImage was the same, i didnt think of getIcon

- getPortalTime(o) is attempt to provide 1 place to define DateTime cstrtime() formats, is ther ea better way to do this?
