plone.po is the English master file for the translations.

To use:

- Go to plone.org and locate the internationalization section 
  (inside development section) and check that a translation isn't already
  in progress for your language. If it is, contact the person listed
  and offer to help with proofreading if it's needed.

- IMPORTANT: Read the guidelines for translating, there are a few things to 
  watch out for before you start translating.
  
- Load the master file in your favorite text editor or use one of the
  dedicated gettext file editors out there (KBabel or GTranslator for
  Linux, poEdit for Windows). I recommend using the dedicated editors
  as these catch errors and makes the whole process easier. Not all of
  them support full UNICODE charset, though, so you might have to use
  a text editor that can handle it.
  
- Be sure that you have read and understood the guidelines, get somebody
  else to proofread your translation, and post it to the Plone i18n list:
  plone-i18n@lists.sourceforge.net

- Your file will be examined for errors, put in CVS and included in the next
  Plone release.

- Thank you very much for spending your valuable time on making Plone really
  useful for the people in your country!
