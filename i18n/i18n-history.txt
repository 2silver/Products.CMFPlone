Added everything between the 17.11.2002 comments at the bottom of the plone.pot.

Added a lot of new strings to reflect the cleanup.
Merging of stings to make them more Japanese/Korean/Chinese-friendly is still 
left to do. Remember to delete the strings on the delete-list below 
if you are updating an existing po-file.
