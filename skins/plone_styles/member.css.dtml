** You should preferrably use ploneCustom.css to add your own CSS classes and to
** customize your portal, as these are the base fundaments of Plone, and will
** change and be refined in newer versions. Keeping your changes in
** ploneCustom.css will make it easier to upgrade.
**
** Feel free to use whole or parts of this for your own designs, but give credit
