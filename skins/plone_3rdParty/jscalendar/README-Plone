This is Mihai Bazon's, aka "mishoo", excellent DHTML Calendar Widget,
("jscalendar") available in original from: http://dynarch.com/mishoo/calendar/

For distribution with Plone, we have only flattened the directory
hierarchy and added this file. Everything else is unchanged. This
means the subdirectories "doc", "doc/html" and "lang" have been
removed, with their contents moved to the top jscalendar directory
instead. This is only in order to avoid making "doc", "doc/html" and
"lang" available from other url's on a site, under Zope's acquisition
logic.

Plone integration
-----------------

- i18n

  jscalendar uses its own translations, i.e. not plone-i18n. The
  jscalendar translations are available in the various calendar-*js
  files.

- skins

  jscalendar comes with several default skins, if you want to change
  the skin, please customize Plone's plone_templates/header.pt.

- references in Plone files:

  header.pt
      - includes calendar.js, a style sheet and a translation.
  calendar_slot.pt
      - has a javascript onclick handler that calls showJsCalendar in
        plone_javascripts.js
  plone_javascripts.js
      - function showJsCalendar (mimics Calendar.setup() as an ordinary
        function instead of as a handler)
      - function update_date_field

Upgrading Plone's jscalendar
----------------------------

When a new upstream version is available it should be simple to
integrate it with Plone. Just flatten its directory hierarchy and run
"diff -ru jscalendar jscalendar-x.y.x", to see if there are any
changes that might be significant to the Plone integration. Pay close
attention to calendar-setup.js. Any changes there might have to be
reflected in plone_javascripts.js.
