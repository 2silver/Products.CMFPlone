If you're seeing this instead of the web site you were expecting, the owner of
this web site has just installed Plone. Do not contact the Plone Team 
or the Plone mailing lists about this.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you should do is to set up your site by visiting the 
<a href="plone_control_panel">site setup area</a>. Become familiar with Plone by
getting one of the <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/books">Plone books</a>,
and make sure you look at the available 
<a href="http://plone.org/products">add-on products</a>
and
<a href="http://plone.org/documentation">online documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2>Quick Start</h2>

<p>
Some useful hints if you are new to Plone:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Access key + 4 focuses the LiveSearch field - you can start writing 
    your search terms straight away, and have all your information at your 
    fingertips without leaving the keyboard. For information about how to use 
    access keys in your particular browser, see the 
    <a href="accessibility-info">accessibility page</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Plone will automatically be displayed in the language your browser asks for.
    If you need more control over languages in Plone, install Plone Language
    Tool from the <a href="plone_control_panel">site setup</a>. If you need
    to maintain your content in multiple languages, download 
    <a href="http://plone.org/products/linguaplone">LinguaPlone</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Workflow states are color coded if you are logged in, so it is easy to keep
    track of content security and visibility. Try the site map with color 
    coding for a visual security inspection of your site!
    </li>
    
    <li>
    If you prefer working with pure HTML, Structured Text or ReStructured Text
    markup instead of using a visual editor, you can disable it in 
    <a href="plone_memberprefs_panel">your preferences</a>.
    </li> 
</ul>
