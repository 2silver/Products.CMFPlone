0.9.9 - Bola Release:   
    NOTE: apologies for my lack of testing ;)  I will do better.  Also I will slow up on version numbers.
    * fixed up MembershipTool which will add a homepage which will partcipate in workflow
    * added a FormulatorTool (portal_form_validation) which is a *thin* wrapper around Formulator and exposes
      minimal amounts of functionality.  I didnt know about CMFFormsTool when I did this (cmf.zope.org not doing its job)
      so I will have to take another look at whether or not we should go with this more advanced component. 
    * in CSS we have: class="label required" now, and "field error" if a error has occurred.
    * added validation for all xxx_edit_forms, look in plone_scripts/validate_xxxxxx
    * removed plone_images/img, all images are now in plone_images
        WARNING: you should always specify the full url to the image or caching will not occur. ${here/portal_url}/image.gif
        You want to cache as many images on the client side (or in caches in front of your ZOPE) as possible.
    * navigateXXXX scripts were fixed (thanks to AndyD) which were causing some authentication errors
    * seperated form specific scripts into plone_form_scripts (this includes validation scripts)
    * file_view when you download no longers puts trailing 0's and uploaded file and image views
    * file and images will change id's to the uploaded file (strip extension).
      if you *specify* an id, like all other objects the file will be renamed to this id regardless of uploaded file
      there is no validation on file and images
    * fixed folder_edit (renaming was broke) also added validation - if you specify a id, the title is not mandatory.
      we dont want people to have autogenerated ID's in the folder_contents listing
    * plone_calendar added - thanks to AndyD
        calendar now works out of the box - you need to run install_events script!
    * fixed ordinary view and 'up one level'    * ability to remove MyPortrait

0.9.8 - Ulrich Schnauss Release:
    * renaming of objects 
    * more mozilla enhancements
    * calendar support code was optimized (AndyD) 
    * on Memberarea creation creates a .personal folder for Portrait and future private items (by convention)
    * fixed it so that http:// isnt always added to link's remote_url
    * other things I forgot ;'(

0.9.5 - 1/31/02:
    enormous overhaul of entire UI.  UI now works with Mozzila.  Install script installs skins
    navigation boxes work (left hand side)
    worked out most deadends
    some security calls have been put in place
    navigation is much nicer and lends itself to more real-world use of CMF as filesystem/document sharing
    some cleaning up of code, lots of inefficiencies remaining (like listFolderContents)
    breadcrumbs overhauled
    comments have been changed, still more to go before 1.0
    some visual queues exist for users (green border around objects which can be edited)
    plone can now be skinned *entirely* using CSS and overriding the /img folder
        NOTE: you will need to have copies of all the images in your /img folder
    system should never prompt someone for Username/password if they are logged in
    all xxx_edit scripts return back to objects view 
    changing ID works in xxx_edit_form
    you can now customize your 'portrait' in /Members/roster by doing the following:
        create a folder, .personal in your home folder
        create a image in .personal called MyPortrait
        publishing your /Members/xxx/.personal/MyPortrait image
    folder_contents now sort (case insensitive) alphabetically by default, no more 'pagination' in batches of 10
    added current server time in the top right corner ;)
    content_status_history has been simplified -- still hardcoded transitions ;( 
    BSD license added (not final license, as will require some non-visual (?) attribution)  

0.9:
    load of fixes, too many to even attempt to keep track of ;)
0.7:
   folder_edit_form id is editable (not so if its your own member folder id ;)
   new Install.py
   new folder structure (makes more sense)
   new look (content tabs)

0.6:
  * so fast didnt have time to catch 'em

0.5:
  * fixed search form up
  * fixed folder_contents (not have an extended_edit, since we muck w/ metadata alot)
