Installing Plone manually, step by step instructions.

==============================================================================

**SUMMARY**

  1) Download and install Zope
  2) Find your instance's Products directory
  3) Download and install the Plone tarball - http://plone.org/download
     (you most likely have it already since you're reading this, but make
      sure you still have the latest version)
  4) Download and install optional products

  For alternative install docs, try http://plone.org/documentation. They may
  be more up to date, and have useful illustrations to go with them.
  
  There is also a so-called "Universal installer" that works on all
  UNIX-derivatives, that does all of this for you and more. If you're new to
  Plone, it is probably a better choice, since it downloads and compiles
  dependencies (Zope, PIL, elementtree) for you. This document assumes that
  you have some familiarity with the Zope and Plone structure and want to set
  it up manually.

==============================================================================

**INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install Zope

  Install Zope and start it. Check that it's running.

*****************************************************************************
* If you want to run Plone on FreeBSD, you'll need to up the thread stack   *
* size of your python interpreter or else Zope will repeatedly crash!       *
* Compile python with 'make WANT_HUGE_STACK_SIZE=yes' or use the compiler   *
* option CFLAG: -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=0x100000                                *
* Also see: http://plone.org/documentation/faq/plone-on-bsd-python-stack    *
*****************************************************************************

2. Find your instance's Products directory

   The location of this varies from system to system, so to avoid hunting for
   it, go to the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) Control Panel in your Zope's
   root, which will likely be at one of the following URLs:

   http://yourhost:8080/Control_Panel/manage_main
   http://yourhost:9673/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're using Debian)
   http://yourhost/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're proxying through a
                                              front end webserver on port 80)

   This page will tell you your INSTANCE_HOME. There is a Products folder in
   each site's INSTANCE_HOME folder. This is the best place to install add-on
   Products for a site.

   About $SOFTWARE_HOME/Products folder:

   Older products will sometimes instruct you to install in
   SOFTWARE_HOME/Products. SOFTWARE_HOME refers to the lib/python sub-folder
   of the Zope folder. We strongly discourage installing packages in these
   places for two reasons:

    * These folders affect all Plone sites using that version of Zope.
    * If you reinstall Plone, Zope will be replaced.

   Any time you're asked to place packages into a Products folder, choose
   the INSTANCE_HOME/Products folder instead. Thank you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Download and install the Plone tarball

   Unpack the Plone tarball.

   The results will be a directory named Plone-xxxx where
   xxxx is the version. This should contain two subdirectories: Products
   and lib. The Products subdirectory should contain the following
   subdirectories:

   Archetypes
   ATContentTypes
   ATReferenceBrowserWidget
   CacheFu
   CMFActionIcons
   CMFCalendar
   CMFCore
   CMFDefault
   CMFDiffTool
   CMFDynamicViewFTI
   CMFFormController
   CMFPlacefulWorkflow
   CMFPlone
   CMFQuickInstallerTool
   CMFTopic
   CMFUid
   DCWorkflow
   ExtendedPathIndex
   ExternalEditor
   GenericSetup
   GroupUserFolder
   kupu
   MimetypesRegistry
   PasswordResetTool
   PlacelessTranslationService
   PloneErrorReporting
   PloneLanguageTool
   PlonePAS
   PloneTestCase
   PloneTranslations
   PluggableAuthService
   PluginRegistry
   PortalTransforms
   ResourceRegistries
   SecureMailHost
   statusmessages
   validation
   ZopeVersionControl

   Move (or symlink) each of these subdirectories into your
   $INSTANCE_HOME/Products
   directory. If it does not exist, create it.

*****************************************************************************
* Note that each of these is a Product in its own right and *must* be       *
* directly within $INSTANCE_HOME/Products. If you just move the entire CMF  *
* directory into $INSTANCE_HOME/Products, your Zope Instance will *not* be  *
* able to find these required products, and you will not be able to run     *
* Plone.                                                                    *
*****************************************************************************

   The lib/python subdirectory contains a single subdirectory
   named 'plone'. Move this into the $INSTANCE_HOME/lib/python
   directory. If it does not exist, create it.

  It's probably A Good Idea at this point to restart your Zope to load these
  Products, then test that they have installed correctly. You can do this by
  logging into the ZMI - you should have

    1) The Plone Products (CMFPlone etc.) listed in the Products section
       of the Control_Panel
    2) "Plone Site" as one of the options in the "Add" dropdown in the ZMI
       Root Folder

  Complete the install test by adding a Plone Site from the pulldown in the
  root folder.

*****************************************************************************
* Make sure this is not done inside the Control Panel, but in the root of   *
* the Zope site. Zope will unfortunately not stop you from addding a Plone  *
* instance inside the Control Panel, even though it doesn't make sense.     *
*****************************************************************************

  When you do this, it asks you to complete a form, specifying the site's 
  ID (URL element), Title and Description. Complete these fields and hit the
  "Add Plone Site" button. After a short while, you should be looking at a
  basic Plone site containing the details you entered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Download and install optional products

  The above steps install the "mandatory" products.

  Click Site Setup -> Add/Remove Products to install optional products bundled
  with Plone.

  For optional products not bundled with Plone:  Download the product, unpack
  the product into your instance's Products directory, restart Zope, and
  install them in Plone using Site Setup -> "Add/Remove Products."

Enjoy Plone, and don't forget to report any bugs or inconsistencies in the
Plone bug tracker: http://dev.plone.org/plone/

Thank you for using Plone!
