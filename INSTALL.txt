For nicer install docs, try http://plone.org/documentation. They are more up to
date, and have nice and funky pictures to go with them ;)

**Download the following:**

- "Latest Zope":http://www.zope.org/Products (you need at least version 2.4, version 2.5 recommended)

- "Latest CMF":http://cmf.zope.org/download (you need at least version 1.2)

- "Latest Plone":http://plone.org/download

**The installation procedure:**

- Install Zope

- Unpack the CMF directories (CMFCore, CMFDefault etc) into your Products directory

- Unpack the Plone directory (CMFPlone) into your Products directory (also include the DCWorkflow dir if you haven't installed it already)

- Start Zope

- Add a CMF Site instance

- Enter the details of your site

- Now you have added a CMF instance in your Zope installation. To install Plone, enter the management screen:

- We need to add an External method to run the Plone install script (we hope installing skins in the CMF will be 
simpler in the future, but bear with us :)

- Enter the following details, exactly as shown (mind the case difference in Install/install):

  - id: install_plone

  - Title: Installs Plone

  - Module name: CMFPlone.Install

  - Function name: install

- Now we need to execute the External Method once to run the install script. Locate install_plone, and click it:

- To run the script, click the tab labeled "Test" (also called "Try it" in older versions):

- After a few seconds, it will show something like this:

Thank you for helping us improve Plone!
