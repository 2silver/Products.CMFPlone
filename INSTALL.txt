**INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:** 
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
1. Download and install Zope 
 
  Install Zope and start it. Check that it's running.
 
  ***************************************************************************** 
  * If you want to run Plone on FreeBSD, you'll need to up the thread stack   *
  * size of your python interpreter or else Zope will repeatedly crash!       *
  * Compile python with 'make WANT_HUGE_STACK_SIZE=yes' or use the compiler   *
  * option CFLAG: -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=0x100000                                *
  ***************************************************************************** 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
2. Find your instance's Products directory
 
   The location of this varies from system to system, so to avoid hunting for it, 
   go to the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) Control Panel in your Zope's root, 
   which will likely be at one of the following URLs: 
 
   http://yourhost:8080/Control_Panel/manage_main 
   http://yourhost:9673/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're using Debian) 
   http://yourhost/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're proxying through a front 
   end webserver) 
 
   This page will tell you your INSTANCE_HOME. There is a Products folder in each  
   site's INSTANCE_HOME folder. This is the best place to install add-on Products  
   for a site. 
 
      $SOFTWARE_HOME/Products folder 
 
   Sometimes a Product's documentation will instruct you to install it in  
   SOFTWARE_HOME/Products.  SOFTWARE_HOME refers to the lib/python sub-folder of  
   the Zope folder. We strongly discourage installing packages in these places for  
   two reasons: 
 
    * These folders affect all Plone 2 sites using that version of Zope. 
    * If you reinstall Plone 2 or a newer version of Plone 2, Zope will 
      be replaced. 
 
   Any time you're asked to place packages into a Products folder, choose 
   the INSTANCE_HOME/Products folder instead. Thank you! 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
3. Download and install CMFPlone
 
   Unpack the Plone tarball 
 
   The results will be a directory named CMFPlone-xxxx where 
   xxxx is the version. This should contain the following subdirectories: 
 
   ATContentTypes
   Archetypes
   BTreeFolder2
   CMFActionIcons
   CMFCalendar
   CMFCore
   CMFDefault
   CMFFormController
   CMFPlone
   CMFQuickInstallerTool
   CMFTopic
   Epoz
   ExternalEditor
   DCWorkflow
   GroupUserFolder
   MimetypesRegistry
   PlacelessTranslationService
   PloneErrorReporting
   PloneTranslations
   PortalTransforms
   SecureMailHost
   generator
   validation 

   Move (or symlink) each of these subdirectories into your 
   $INSTANCE_HOME/Products 
   directory. If it does not exist, create it.
 
  ***************************************************************************** 
  * Note that each of these is a Product in its own right and *must* be       * 
  * directly within $INSTANCE_HOME/Products. If you just move the entire CMF  * 
  * directory into $INSTANCE_HOME/Products, your Zope Instance will *not* be  * 
  * able to find these required products, and you will not be able to run     * 
  * Plone.                                                                    * 
  ***************************************************************************** 
 
  It's probably A Good Idea at this point to restart your Zope to load these 
  Products, then test that they have installed correctly. You can do this by 
  logging into the ZMI - you should have  
 
    1) The Plone Products (BTreeFolder2 etc.) listed in the Products section of  
       the Control_Panel 
    2) "Plone Site" as one of the options in the "Add" dropdown in the ZMI Root 
       Folder 
 
  Complete the install test by adding a Plone Site from the pulldown in the root
  folder. 
  
  *****************************************************************************
  * Make sure this is not done inside the Control Panel, but in the root of   *
  * the Zope site.                                                            *
  *****************************************************************************
  
  When you do this, it asks you to complete a form, specifying the site's Id,
  Title, Description and where your members' user folder should be. Complete 
  these fields and hit the "Add Plone Site" button. After a short while, you
  should be looking at a basic Plone site containing the details you entered. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
4. Download and install optional products
 
  The above steps install the "mandatory" products.
 
  Use Plone Setup's "Add/Remove Products" to install optional products bundled 
  with Plone: Archetypes, PloneErrorReporting, and PortalTransforms.  
 
  For optional products not bundled with Plone:  Download the product, unpack the 
  product into your instance's Products directory, restart Zope, and install them 
  in Plone using Plone Setup's "Add/Remove Products."
 
=============================================================================== 
Have fun, and don't forget to report any bugs or inconsistencies in the 
Plone Collector (use the ErrorReporting product!): http://plone.org/collector 
 
Thank you for using Plone!
