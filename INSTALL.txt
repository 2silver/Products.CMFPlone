**The installation procedure:**

- Install Zope

- Unpack the CMF directories (CMFCore, CMFDefault etc) into your Products 
  directory. Note: when you unpack the CMF, you will get a folder like CMF-xxxx 
  where x is the version. You need the contents of that directory.

- Unpack the Plone directory (CMFPlone) into your Products directory 
  (also include the DCWorkflow and Formulator products)

- Unpack all the other Products listed above into your Products dir

- Start Zope

- From /manage interface there should be a 'Select Type to Add' that says
  Plone Site.  click on that, fill in information and voilá!

- This means that installation of Plone was successful. Go to the front page, 
  and have a look at your new Plone site.

- If you want to set up translations for your Plone site, there is documentation
  available on plone.org in the Development section. Plone comes with a lot of
  language files, have a look in the i18n directory.

- Have fun, and don't forget to report any bugs or inconsistencies in the 
  "Plone Collector":http://plone.org/collector

Thank you for helping us improve Plone!
