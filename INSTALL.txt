Installing Plone manually, step by step instructions.

==============================================================================

**SUMMARY**

  1) Download and install Zope
  2) Find your instance's Products directory
  3) Download and install the Plone tarball - http://plone.org/download
     (you most likely have it already since you're reading this, but make
      sure you still have the latest version)
  4) Download and install optional products

  For alternative install docs, try http://plone.org/documentation. They may
  be more up to date, and have useful illustrations to go with them.
  
  There is also a so-called "Universal installer" that works on all
  UNIX-derivatives, that does all of this for you and more. If you're new to
  Plone, it is probably a better choice, since it downloads and compiles
  dependencies (Zope, PIL, elementtree) for you. This document assumes that
  you have some familiarity with the Zope and Plone structure and want to set
  it up manually.

==============================================================================

**ASSUMPTIONS**

  1) You are running a *nix server
  2) You are comfortable with standard Unix commands, including
     * wget or svn
     * tar
     * symlinking
  3) You are familiar with logging into the Zope Management Interface

**INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install Zope

  Install Zope and start it. Check that it's running.

*****************************************************************************
* If you want to run Plone on FreeBSD, you'll need to up the thread stack   *
* size of your python interpreter or else Zope will repeatedly crash!       *
* Compile python with 'make WANT_HUGE_STACK_SIZE=yes' or use the compiler   *
* option CFLAG: -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=0x100000                                *
* Also see: http://plone.org/documentation/faq/plone-on-bsd-python-stack    *
*****************************************************************************

2. Find your instance's home directory.

   The location of this varies from system to system, so to avoid hunting for
   it, go to the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) Control Panel in your Zope's
   root, which will likely be at one of the following URLs:

   http://yourhost:8080/Control_Panel/manage_main
   http://yourhost:9673/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're using Debian)
   http://yourhost/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're proxying through a
                                              front end webserver on port 80)

   This page will tell you your INSTANCE_HOME. There are two important
   directories in the site's INSTANCE_HOME directory: the Products folder
   in which Zope Products can be installed and the lib/python directory
   which is used for python packages that will only be used by this Zope
   instance. 

   About $SOFTWARE_HOME/Products folder:

   Older products will sometimes instruct you to install in
   SOFTWARE_HOME/Products. SOFTWARE_HOME refers to the lib/python sub-folder
   of the Zope folder. We strongly discourage installing packages in these
   places for two reasons:

    * These folders affect all Plone sites using that version of Zope.
    * If you reinstall Zope, Plone will be replaced.

   Any time you're asked to place packages into a Products folder, choose
   the INSTANCE_HOME/Products folder instead. Thank you!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Download and install the Plone tarball

   Unpack the Plone tarball.

   The results will be a directory named Plone-xxxx where
   xxxx is the version. This should contain two subdirectories: Products
   and lib.

   Move those two subdirectories into your $INSTANCE_HOME directory. You need
   to remove the two existing directories beforehand.

  You whave to restart your Zope to load these Products and new packages, then
  test that they have installed correctly. You can do this by logging into the
  ZMI - you should have

    1) The Plone Products (CMFPlone etc.) listed in the Products section
       of the Control_Panel
    2) "Plone Site" as one of the options in the "Add" dropdown in the ZMI
       Root Folder

  Complete the install test by adding a Plone Site from the pulldown in the
  root folder.

*****************************************************************************
* Make sure this is not done inside the Control Panel, but in the root of   *
* the Zope site. Zope will unfortunately not stop you from addding a Plone  *
* instance inside the Control Panel, even though it doesn't make sense.     *
*****************************************************************************

  When you do this, it asks you to complete a form, specifying the site's 
  ID (URL element), Title and Description. Complete these fields and hit the
  "Add Plone Site" button. After a short while, you will end up in the ZMI
  again, but should see your Plone site listed in there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Download and install optional products

  The above steps install the "mandatory" products.

  Click Site Setup -> Add/Remove Products to install optional products bundled
  with Plone.

  For optional products not bundled with Plone:  Download the product, unpack
  the product into your instance's Products directory, restart Zope, and
  install them in Plone using Site Setup -> "Add/Remove Products."
