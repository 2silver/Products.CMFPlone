**INSTALLATION PROCEDURE:**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download and install Zope

  Install Zope and start it. Check that it's running.

  *****************************************************************************
  * If you want to run Plone on FreeBSD, you'll need to up the thread stack   *
  * size of your python interpreter or else Zope will repeatedly crash!       *
  * Compile python with 'make WANT_HUGE_STACK_SIZE=yes' or use the compiler   *
  * option CFLAG: -DTHREAD_STACK_SIZE=0x100000                                *
  *****************************************************************************
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Find your instance's Products directory

   The location of this varies from system to system, so to avoid hunting for it,
   go to the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) Control Panel in your Zope's root,
   which will likely be at one of the following URLs:

   http://yourhost:8080/Control_Panel/manage_main
   http://yourhost:9673/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're using Debian)
   http://yourhost/Control_Panel/manage_main (if you're proxying through a front
   end webserver)

   This page will tell you your INSTANCE_HOME. There is a Products folder in each
   site's INSTANCE_HOME folder. This is the best place to install add-on Products
   for a site.

      $SOFTWARE_HOME/Products folder

   Sometimes a Product's documentation will instruct you to install it in
   SOFTWARE_HOME/Products. SOFTWARE_HOME refers to the lib/python sub-folder of
   the Zope folder. We strongly discourage installing packages in these places for
   two reasons:

    * These folders affect all Plone sites using that version of Zope.
    * If you reinstall Plone, Zope will be replaced.

   Any time you're asked to place packages into a Products folder, choose
   the INSTANCE_HOME/Products folder instead. Thank you!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Download and install CMFPlone

   Unpack the Plone tarball

   The results will be a directory named CMFPlone-xxxx where
   xxxx is the version. This should contain the following subdirectories:

   Archetypes
   ATContentTypes
   ATReferenceBrowserWidget
   CacheFu
   CMFActionIcons
   CMFCalendar
   CMFCore
   CMFDefault
   CMFDynamicViewFTI
   CMFFormController
   CMFPlacefulWorkflow
   CMFPlone
   CMFQuickInstallerTool
   CMFSetup
   CMFTopic
   CMFUid
   DCWorkflow
   ExtendedPathIndex
   ExternalEditor
   GenericSetup
   GroupUserFolder
   kupu
   MimetypesRegistry
   PasswordResetTool
   PlacelessTranslationService
   PloneErrorReporting
   PloneLanguageTool
   PlonePAS
   PloneTranslations
   PluggableAuthService
   PluginRegistry
   PortalTransforms
   ResourceRegistries
   SecureMailHost
   statusmessages
   validation

   Move (or symlink) each of these subdirectories into your
   $INSTANCE_HOME/Products
   directory. If it does not exist, create it.

  *****************************************************************************
  * Note that each of these is a Product in its own right and *must* be       *
  * directly within $INSTANCE_HOME/Products. If you just move the entire CMF  *
  * directory into $INSTANCE_HOME/Products, your Zope Instance will *not* be  *
  * able to find these required products, and you will not be able to run     *
  * Plone.                                                                    *
  *****************************************************************************

  It's probably A Good Idea at this point to restart your Zope to load these
  Products, then test that they have installed correctly. You can do this by
  logging into the ZMI - you should have

    1) The Plone Products (BTreeFolder2 etc.) listed in the Products section of
       the Control_Panel
    2) "Plone Site" as one of the options in the "Add" dropdown in the ZMI Root
       Folder

  Complete the install test by adding a Plone Site from the pulldown in the root
  folder.

  *****************************************************************************
  * Make sure this is not done inside the Control Panel, but in the root of   *
  * the Zope site.                                                            *
  *****************************************************************************

  When you do this, it asks you to complete a form, specifying the site's Id,
  Title, Description and where your members' user folder should be. Complete
  these fields and hit the "Add Plone Site" button. After a short while, you
  should be looking at a basic Plone site containing the details you entered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Download and install optional products

  The above steps install the "mandatory" products.

  Use Plone Setup's "Add/Remove Products" to install optional products bundled
  with Plone: PloneErrorReporting

  For optional products not bundled with Plone:  Download the product, unpack the
  product into your instance's Products directory, restart Zope, and install them
  in Plone using Plone Setup's "Add/Remove Products."
