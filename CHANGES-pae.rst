Changelog for plone.app.event changes
=====================================

- Don't install p.a.event by default. Hide the default profile. So one can
  explicitly choose to install Archetypes plone.app.event.at or Dexterity
  plone.app.event.dx.

- Base profile memberdata_properties.xml now includes timezone member
  property.

- Depend on plone.app.event with Archetypes dependencies. Install with
  "default" and "at" profiles.  Remove now unused code.
