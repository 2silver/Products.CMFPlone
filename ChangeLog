	* skins/plone_scripts/navigationLocalRelated.py: Fixing collector
	issue 1067. The existing Implementation not only excluded links to

	original documents' id.

	tests/testMembershipTool.py: changed personalise_form to use the
	portrait from membershiptool. fixed changeMemberPortrait when not
	getting an id. commented out obsolete unittest. added new one that
	does not yet anything

2003-09-18 20:57  runyaga

	* skins/plone_form_scripts/folder_localrole_edit.py,
	tests/testFolderLocalRoleForm.py: cleaned up folder_localrole_edit
	added a test that I believe demonstrates that GRUF is possibly not
	doing the right thing when called?  Stefan is this correct? can I
	commit() like this? in the framework? will it begin() a new trnx? 
	I need to read the docs! ;-)
	
	I will get PJ to look at this.	But it seems that when GRUF gets
	the object to inspect for context it ends up getting a
	RequestContainer not a 'Plone Folder'

	* skins/plone_portlets/: events_slot.pt, news_slot.pt,
	recently_published_slot.pt, workflow_review_slot.pt: All portlets

2003-09-18 19:53  zworkb

	* StatelessTree.py: the last checkin brought an indentation error
	that caused published content not to be displayed for anon users.

2003-09-18 19:53  runyaga

	* Portal.py: by default run the 'Default Plone' custom policy. 
	Very ugly that this was set in HTML via hidden form element.  It
	should not be there and just be the default for the args in
	manage_addSite.

2003-09-18 19:46  limi

	* skins/plone_styles/: plone.css.dtml, stylesheet_properties.props:

	* skins/plone_forms/content_status_history.pt: on publishing form
	made the 'default' (nonaction) transition called 'No change' this
	will need to be fixed by the i18n groups

2003-09-18 18:15  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py: check permissions on the object in contentEdit. 
	contentEdit is Publicly accesible but the object is checked for
	ModifyPortalContent permissions.  This is not necessarily VALID! 
	But there is no other way of doing this because you do not know
	what the "edit" method permission of the object is.  This is a
	Zope/CMF design flaw.

2003-09-18 17:52  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py, skins/plone_scripts/folder_publish.py: protected
	contentEdit/metadataEdit methods on plone_utils and folder_publish
	will apply effective/expiry dates if defined in the content status
	form

2003-09-18 17:15  runyaga

	* skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt:
	here/folder_contents/macros/folder_listing is used in
	content_status_modify (reuse is good) but the isOrdered and the
	interface assertions were defined above the folder_listing macro
	;-( moved them into the macro

2003-08-23 08:56  dreamcatcher

	* skins/: plone_forms/search.pt, plone_templates/footer.pt: Remove
	unneeded 'border=0' plus some whitespace cleaning

2003-08-22 13:46  zworkb

	trashcan, there were some debris in folder_delete.py

2003-08-22 13:31  eaon

2003-08-20 17:37  runyaga

	* skins/plone_content/metadata_edit_form.pt: [no log message]

2003-08-20 07:05  tesdal

	* skins/plone_templates/sendto_template.pt: Added a space after the
	signature separator, now it's "-- " instead of "--"

2003-08-18 11:16  jb7

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: set border: none to
	.hiddenstructure (it inherited it e.g. when used together with h5)

2003-08-18 09:46  jb7

	* skins/plone_ecmascript/plone_javascripts.js.dtml: corrected
	javascript error: the id of the document is documentContent, not
	bodyContent

2003-08-17 23:22  eaon

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: 
	made stylesheet ie 5.5 compatible, made some tab spaces "plonish"

2003-08-17 21:19  ronnix

	* skins/plone_styles/plonePrint.css.dtml: Catch up with recent
	changes.

2003-08-17 15:20  philikon

	* __init__.py: runyaga must have forgotten to check in the
	SyndicationTool module.

2003-08-17 14:37  runyaga

	* ActionsTool.py, HISTORY.txt, MetadataTool.py, Portal.py,
	TypesTool.py, UndoTool.py, __init__.py: now a SiteErrorLog is
	created in a newly constructed Plone.  Also starting to add
	Subclasses of core CMF tools so if we need to extend them it will
	be easier

2003-08-17 14:12  ronnix

	* skins/plone_forms/password_form.pt: Fixed i18n msgid.

2003-08-17 14:02  runyaga

	* URLTool.py, __init__.py: adding URLTool for Plone.  We should
	subclass *all* default tools that come with CMF.  The biggest
	problem we have is migrating people upwards.  So for 1.1 it might
	make sense to subclass all default tools and instead of creating
	the defaults using our subclasses.  this gives us a extension point
	into the all the tools.
	
	this will help quite a bit when we start moving to use the
	eventservice

2003-08-17 13:59  runyaga

	* HISTORY.txt: removal of portal_form_validation

2003-08-17 13:58  runyaga

	 did not remove the .py file.  will do that in 1.2

2003-08-17 13:21  runyaga

	prefs_group_members.pt, prefs_groups_overview.pt,

2003-08-16 23:38  runyaga

	* PloneTool.py, skins/plone_content/metadata_edit_form.pt: someone
	broke metadata form at some point.  cleaned up PloneTool.
	
	NOTE: CMFDefault PortalContent no declares the Discussionable xface
	which makes discussions no longer work with Plone on metadata form.

2003-08-16 16:28  plonista

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Added a title

2003-08-16 16:27  plonista

	* www/portal_factory_manage_overview.zpt: Initial check-in

2003-08-16 16:21  runyaga

	* skins/plone_scripts/createObject.py: CMFFormController has odd
	interactions with traversal/absolute_url now we can work with the
	new PloneWorkspaces component

2003-08-16 14:10  runyaga

	* HISTORY.txt, MembershipTool.py, Extensions/Upgrade.py: password
	changing now works again against all modern UserFolders that

	modifying site properties.

2003-08-14 06:21  tesdal

	stage

	AttributeError.  test() is not a short circuit operator :-/

2003-08-13 07:51  tesdal

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Fixed a bug on unregistering configlets. 
	When deleting actions you pass the indexes to delete, not the
	actions or action ids to delete.

2003-08-12 20:30  limi

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Some fixes to the new ul-based
	personalBar - thanks to Arnia for the initial work, and eaon for
	fixing some CSS bugs.

2003-08-12 19:10  zopezen

	* setup/dependencies.py: Neither of these are errors, just
	information. Set severity as such, they will now show up as per the
	users settings in zope 2.7

2003-08-12 16:58  runyaga

	* skins/plone_forms/history_form.pt: move the tal:define into table
	out of form define's happen before conditions.	also made aesthetic
	changes

2003-08-11 18:31  arnia

2003-08-11 18:13  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/: global_elements.pt, view_tabs.pt: Removed
	firstItem and lastItem until I can figure out how to implement them
	properly. Sorry for the breakage.

2003-08-11 12:43  limi

	* setup/ConfigurationMethods.py: Changed ordering of the boxes
	slightly.

2003-08-11 08:10  arnia

	message]

2003-08-11 05:35  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Added firstItem and
	lastItem classes to the personalBar list. Yay for endcaps

2003-08-11 05:08  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/main_template.pt: Made .document and
	.editableDocument mutually exclusive

2003-08-11 04:53  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/: global_elements.pt, main_template.pt,
	view_tabs.pt: Classes for unique chrome now completely removed. We
	don't need them if people will have to rewrite their CSS files
	anyway, and this will remove temptation to use the classes.

2003-08-11 04:42  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Personal bar now uses unordered
	list. Images in personal bar now in CSS. Hidden (yet screenreader
	accessible) structural labels to cope with list overload (thanks to
	Eaon for idea)

2003-08-11 04:18  zworkb

	* skins/plone_scripts/prepare_slots.py: #check if the *_slots
	attributes are callable so that they can be overridden #by methods
	or python scripts

2003-08-11 03:20  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/global_elements.pt, plone_templates/view_tabs.pt:
	Content actions are now in an unordered list. .selected class moved
	to list item for greater flexibility. Stylesheets tidied up again
	to match templates.

2003-08-11 02:54  arnia

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/global_elements.pt,
	plone_templates/site_actions.pt: Added firstItem and lastItem
	classes to first and last list items in autogenerated lists to
	workaround IE's lack of support for CSS2 selectors. Moved
	stylesheets over to using ids rather than classes (faster
	rendering) and tidied up the portaltabs selectors to allow removal
	of portaltab class from template (redundant information)

2003-08-11 02:23  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/: global_elements.pt, main_template.pt:
	Added ids in parallel to classes on unique chrome elements to
	deprecate classes on these elements. Classes are much slower to
	render than ids so avoid if possible!

2003-08-10 07:27  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plonePresentation.css.dtml: Hiding the skipnav
	in the presentation stylesheet

2003-08-10 07:16  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/: plone.css.dtml, stylesheet_properties.props:
	More spacing fixes for the header - credits to Eaon

2003-08-10 06:35  arnia

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: Fixing a spacing problem as a
	result of moving the location of the logo class

2003-08-09 18:41  arnia

	* skins/plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Fixed the label in the
	search widget so pages validate as XHTML1.0 Transitional and moved
	the logo class to the anchor for more flexible skinning.

2003-08-08 09:44  limi

	* setup/ConfigurationMethods.py,
	skins/plone_forms/login_success.pt,
	skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	skins/plone_templates/recently_published.pt: Added a new slot for
	items published since your last login, activated it on new site
	creation (don't put this in migrations, as it shouldn't suddenly
	pop up on an existing site).
	
	It also has a link to a page listing all the published items in
	reversely chronological order.
	
	Added a new a.more class for the "More..." links to be used in
	slots.

2003-08-05 22:20  runyaga

	* HISTORY.txt, MembershipTool.py,
	skins/plone_forms/password_form.pt: changing passwords now requires
	a user to know their 'current' password.  also change the scripts
	name to 'plone_change_password' instead of 'change_password' to
	reduce likelihood of namespace collision.  gruf still must change
	their script id as well.

2003-08-05 19:09  runyaga

	* migrations/: __init__.py, one03_one04.py: added noop migration
	from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4

	setup/ConfigurationMethods.py,
	skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt,
	skins/plone_templates/main_template.pt: removed ancient migrations
	folded all plone1.1 relevant construction methods into the plone1_1
	module called by PloneGenerator which now setsInstance(1.1) and
	calls make_plone
	
	status tabs are now resposibility of individual portal_types
	instead of global definition on portal_actions
	
	made images for the contents in a folder absolute with portal_url

2003-08-05 02:42  runyaga

	* skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt: image urls in
	folder_contents are anchored with portal instead of content/$icon

2003-08-05 02:39  runyaga

	* version.txt: [no log message]

2003-08-05 01:47  runyaga

	* skins/plone_templates/folder_contents.pt: generate icon URL in
	folder entries that are anchored by portal instead of the context..
	these URL's are more cache friendly

2003-08-04 22:14  limi

	* HISTORY.txt: History updated with WAI-A/508 details

2003-08-04 20:35  runyaga

	* FactoryTool.py: Fixed location of newly created objects.

2003-08-03 18:08  ronnix

	* PloneFolder.py: Folder default views should work as advertised
	now...

2003-08-03 18:05  ronnix

	* PloneFolder.py: Oops. Forgot to make 'folderlisting' type action
	invisible...

2003-08-03 17:39  ronnix

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: Hopefully fixing remaining
	issues with default folder views.

2003-08-03 17:29  ronnix

	* PloneFolder.py: Hopefully fixing remaining issues with default
	folder views.

2003-08-03 17:25  ronnix

	issues with default folder views.

2003-08-03 16:42  ronnix

	* skins/plone_scripts/breadcrumbs.py: Remove trailing 'view' from
	links to folders.  This gives us identical links in the breadcrumbs
	and in the nav box, hopefully reducing user confusion...

2003-07-30 22:15  plonista

	* HISTORY.txt: Updated HISTORY

2003-07-30 22:11  plonista

	* ChangeLog: Updated the ChangeLog

2003-07-30 21:35  plonista

	* FactoryTool.py, FormTool.py: Big rewrite of FactoryTool so that
	permissions of the temporary object are created properly.  The
	fixed version is a bit more efficient than the old version, but it
	requires some minor changes to FormTool.

2003-07-30 21:05  jccooper

	* skins/plone_forms/: prefs_group_details.pt,
	prefs_group_members.pt: fix for invalid of missing name

2003-07-30 03:46  zworkb

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: philikon: your last change
	broke plone, because PloneFolder has no action called
	'folderlisting' I never had this recursion problem, but in order to
	avoid the recursion I return 'folder_listing' as string, since the
	action does not exist.

2003-07-29 21:19  zworkb

	* StatelessTree.py, StatelessTreeNav.py: added property
	'idsNotToList' that suppresses certain ids to be displayed in the
	navtree

2003-07-29 17:38  limi

	* skins/plone_images/rss.gif: Forgot to check in the RSS icon :)

	externaleditor.

2003-07-29 00:03  limi

	* skins/plone_wysiwyg/wysiwyg_popup.pt: Removed the wysiwyg_popup,
	afaik it was a file from the old XS editor days, and shouldn't be
	here anymore.

2003-07-28 23:27  dreamcatcher

	* ChangeLog, skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: BrowserDefault
	lookup on Context

2003-07-28 22:30  limi

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py,
	skins/plone_images/extedit_icon.gif: - Added support for FrontPage
	as default page in a folder (for ZWiki) - Added External Editor
	icon and functionality to the documentActions. Somebody else will
	have to look at the permissions and the checking of the site
	properties, I couldn't get them to work.

2003-07-27 19:43  limi

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/global_elements.pt,
	plone_templates/main_template.pt: Added the super secret (well,
	maybe not anymore ;) roles-based task switcher stuff to the
	template. No code for it yet, but I want to avoid changing
	main_template later.

2003-07-27 18:58  philikon

	* skins/plone_scripts/browserDefault.py: Do not return the 'view'
	action on an empty folder because that will invoke this script
	again, thus sending the ZPublisher to recursion hell.

2003-07-27 08:59  limi

	* PloneControlPanel.py: Added user icon

2003-07-27 08:56  limi

	most common projector resolution.

2003-07-27 08:31  limi

	* PloneControlPanel.py, skins/plone_forms/plone_control_panel.pt:
	Wired up User/Group Management to the Control Panel so people can

	skins/plone_images/plone_powered.gif, skins/plone_images/xml.gif,
	skins/plone_templates/footer.pt: Replaced the XML button with an
	RSS one, added proper RSS and XML icons, changed templates and
	migration to reflect this.

2003-07-26 03:54  limi

	* MigrationTool.py: Changed the end-of-migration message to sound
	less like something went wrong.
	
	Earlier it said: "No upgrade path found from that version,
	migration stopping"
	
	Now it says: "Your ZODB and Filesystem Plone instances are
	up-to-date."
	
	Thanks to David Coe and Kirk Lowery for pointing this out.

2003-07-26 00:44  limi

	* HISTORY.txt: Added Geoff's portal_factory notes

2003-07-25 18:19  limi

	* setup/dependencies.py: The wording sounded like ExternalEditor
	was absolutely necessary to get Plone running. Changed it to sound
	like it's optional (which it is)

2003-07-24 22:23  limi

	* skins/plone_templates/view_tabs.pt: Fixed it so that the content
	bar doesn't collapse if the item is not workflowable.

2003-07-24 19:10  limi

	* www/migrationRun.dtml: Made it painfully clear that backup is a
	good idea before migrating.

2003-07-24 06:54  vladoi

	* skins/plone_forms/login_form.pt: [no log message]

2003-07-24 06:45  vladoi

2003-07-23 19:32  zworkb

	script ;-)

2003-07-22 18:58  limi

	* HISTORY.txt: Removed the CMFWeblog templates and added them in
	the product itself instead. (In Collective CVS)

2003-07-22 16:13  zopezen

	* PloneInitialize.py: where did out = [] go?

2003-07-22 11:10  plonista

2003-07-21 17:00  plonista

	* FactoryTool.py, Portal.py, StatelessTreeNav.py,
	RegistrationTool.py, __init__.py, migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py,
	skins/plone_scripts/breadcrumbs.py,
	skins/plone_scripts/createObject.py: * Factory tool from CMFMember
	is now wired in.  To use the factory tool when creating an object,
	enter the object's class name in
	site_properties.portal_factory_types.
	
	* I discovered some brokenness in StatelessTreeNav.py.	There's a
	comment that describes it fully plus a kludgey workaround.
	
	* There is a new registration tool that does better password
	generation.  Passwords can't have 1, I, l, 0, or O -- that way it's
	harder for people to misread their passwords.

2003-07-19 16:47  sh1mmer

	* skins/plone_styles/plone.css.dtml: Added skipnav class

2003-07-19 16:44  sh1mmer

2003-07-16 02:54  zopezen

	* skins/plone_content/metadata_edit_form.pt: (23:49:09) Alan
	Runyan: isDisussable is old (23:49:11) Alan Runyan: we should use
	(23:49:21) Alan Runyan:
	here.portal_discussions.isDiscussionAllowedFor()

2003-07-16 02:45  zopezen

	Get rid of ConfigurationMethods for 1.3 and move the rest into
	setup Move dependencies into setup Put Customisation Policy back on
	front page

2003-07-16 01:28  zopezen

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Oops :)

2003-07-16 01:04  zopezen

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Change the plone_help thing to
	look in help rather than docs, because nothing in docs is suitable
	to show to anybody and we can have two levels of docs, docs for
	installers / developers, help for end users

2003-07-16 01:02  zopezen

	* MigrationTool.py, Portal.py: Stop the migration tool swallowing
	all errors, remove runyaga's change, not sure why thats needed

2003-07-16 00:56  zopezen

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Move the commit() up a notch to
	the top of the script, its terrible to have this in a migration
	script, but this way if it fails it can be re-run without anything
	blowing up

2003-07-15 23:38  zopezen

	* dependencies.py: Maybe telling people that GroupUserFolder is
	required would be an idea...

2003-07-14 23:34  runyaga

	* MigrationTool.py, migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py:  - moved stmt's
	into several functions and general upg_1x reformatting.
	 - MigrationTool when it borks now logs stuff in error_log
	 - You MUST use QuickInstaller in CVS (as it was severely borken)
	and now
	   we depend on the Exception, AlreadyInstalled

	concept

2003-07-12 12:37  zopezen

2003-07-11 04:21  sh1mmer

	new url that WaSP ask you to use.

2003-07-08 19:40  plonista

2003-07-08 19:40  plonista

	* HISTORY.txt, migrations/one03_one04.py: Modified cookie testing

2003-07-08 19:37  plonista

	* skins/: plone_forms/logged_in.py, plone_forms/login_failed.pt,

2003-07-04 14:11  zopezen

	* skins/plone_debug/getCTReasons.py: Ooh this just solved some
	silly issue for me, add a few more cases.

2003-07-04 13:55  zopezen

	* skins/plone_debug/getCTReasons.py: Handle _debug in top folder

2003-07-01 21:46  zworkb

	mail_password_template.dtml from CMFDefault (its not anymore in the
	path)

2003-07-01 20:33  zworkb

	it broke CMFMember (the Member class has a __call__ method)

2003-07-01 16:52  zworkb

	* PropertiesTool.py: reconfigure_portal action now points to
	plone_control_panel

2003-06-29 21:54  sh1mmer

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Yeah well, get the latest version

	a corner*

2003-06-29 20:58  sh1mmer

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: Commented out GRUF migration
	because it was breaking stuff. Alan or someone can fix it later but
	I thought it was more important to have a work migration because
	right now all plone .1.1 including 1.1a1 installations cant add new
	sites (the migration breaks at 1.0.3).

2003-06-29 18:19  ronnix

	* dependencies.py, docs/REQUIREMENTS.txt: Updated list of required
	products.

2003-06-29 17:08  mjablonski

2003-06-28 21:25  sh1mmer

	tabs to allow for some more funky css control. Think csszengarden
	meets plone.

2003-06-27 17:59  jccooper

	* skins/plone_forms/prefs_groups_overview.pt: ability to add groups
	TTP. someone will doubtless want to look at the control flow for
	usability.

2003-06-26 11:23  runyaga

	* migrations/upg_1_0_1_to_1_1.py: add 1.0.x to 1.1 migrations

	* skins/: plone_styles/plone.css.dtml,
	plone_templates/folder_contents.pt, plone_templates/footer.pt,
	plone_templates/global_elements.pt: Added accessibility support
	upto WAI-AAA. Added styles for form labels, adding labels to all
	input and select form elements. Removed deprecated tags (zopezen
	also added a monkey patch to fix a known zope bug for this
	purpose). Fixed accesskeys.

2003-06-26 10:14  runyaga

	* PloneFolder.py: added sort_on and reverse to contentValues

2003-06-26 02:45  zopezen

	* imagePatch.py: of course FSImage has its own code, why wouldn't
	it?

2003-06-26 02:25  zopezen

	* __init__.py, imagePatch.py: This is just ridiculous, for 2.6.x
	support. Be happy we can delete this soon

2003-06-26 02:00  zopezen

	* __init__.py: Override an Images tag method, so that border is set
	0 and hence passes the WAI tests. This was for sh1mmer so he could
	check the WAI stuff in. If anyone knows a better way than this
	monkey patching, yell now :)

2003-06-25 21:24  ronnix

	* skins/plone_forms/search_rss.dtml: Added XML encoding
	declaration.

2003-06-25 21:19  ronnix

	prefs_group_members.pt, prefs_groups_overview.pt,
	prefs_user_details.pt, prefs_user_memberships.pt,
	prefs_users_overview.pt: Changing the prelimiary TTP interface for
	user/group management to use the new groups tools. These currently
	live in a GRUF branch (groups-tool-branch) and these pages will not
	work without such an install of GRUF, plus addition of the new
	tools. You currently must do this manually, or this won't work, but
	nobody uses these pages yet anyway.

2003-06-25 17:49  ronnix

	- Alan or Sidnei will have to take a look at the "do not render the
	TD if column is empty" code - at the moment it's inside the
	portlets_fetcher template, and obviously doesn't work. It should
	probably be in main_template, try to make it as minimal as possible
	- as main_template shouldn't really have code, only structure :)
	
	- Improved fix for IE6 disappearing text bug - it should not be
	technically possible to get this anymore ;)
	
	- Removed excessive divs in code, converted some classes to IDs.
	
	- Tweaked margins and padding of all elements, Plone should be
	symmetrical again ;)

	and registered them removed teh 'view' action for a Folder to make
	it '' so that it uses the _getViewFor() machinery...
	
	if the 'view' for a folder is 'hardcoded' (by assigning it a
	action) it will only goto the action.  if it is missing it will
	fall back to logic inside of PloneFolder.  This is how
	SkinnedFolders work.  Its rather ugly and counter intuitivie ...

	Moz, Opera and NS4, needs Mac IE testing) - Major refactoring of
	the main_template, it's now squeaky clean - Cleanups in CSS -
	DOCTYPE is correctly positioned - All templates have been correctly
	formatted with regard to this

	DTML support is really making things ugly you will see lots of
	things like:
	
	portal_url portal_url|here/portal_url;
	
	because in DTML macros are rendered w/o any context really so they
	must be autonomous and not depend on existence of other variables. 
	maybe this just demonstrates that backwards compatibility comes
	with price of speed/ugliness

	* MigrationTool.py, migrations/beta3_rc1.py: if MigrationTool is
	not in a CMF site .. raise an Exception just finished helping the
	5th person with this.. it would be nice for the migration tool to
	be usable *outside* of a Plone site.. and then it would
	recursivvely upgrade all your plones ;-)
	
	also fixed type in beta3_rc1

2003-01-06 20:25  tesdal

	* PloneTool.py, __init__.py, skins/plone_forms/logged_in.py,
	skins/plone_scripts/check_id.py: * __init__.py: code cleanup --
	removed allow_class fn and used the equivalent one from
	AccessControl instead
	
	* __init__.py: granted python scripts access to ObjectMoved and
	ObjectDeleted workflow exceptions -- I don't think DCWorkflow
	swallows these.  If workflow-invoked methods raise these exceptions
	when they move/delete their context object, I think we can make
	content_status_modify behave appropriately
	
	* PloneTool: fixed some broken code in _renameObject, cleaned up
	code a bit, removed a memory leak in exceptionString caused by
	circular references, added logException method that lets us dump
	exception tracebacks to the log even if we consume them elsewhere
	
	* logged_in: cast date to a DateTime (hazmat caught this but
	checked the fix into HEAD)
	
	* check_id: added code to deal with a PortalFolder's restriction
	that disallows any duplication of ids in the root folder, also made
	minor fix on returned values
	
	* register.py: use the new logException function in PloneTool to
	log SMTP exceptions
	
	* validate_document_edit.py, validate_file_edit.py,
	validate_image_edit.py, validate_id.py: PloneTool._renameObject
	strips spaces from ids when renaming objects, so we need to strip
	spaces before checking ids

2003-01-03 12:53  k_vertigo

	* skins/plone_forms/logged_in.py: 
	ignore me, forget the line continuation marker...

	event, link, newsitem, folder) all   work with portal_factory. 
	Cleaned up some minor edit form bugs and added some form titles
	where	they were missing.  * Fixed a bug in which uploading two
	files with the same name in the same folder caused an id  
	collision and dumped you into the ZMI.	* Made ids optional for the
	main portal types (file, image, document, event, link, newsitem,
	folder).     If no id is specified, uses the object's current id. 
	Fixes issue 66.  * Per the request of our usability guru, for items
	that can have their id set from a file name   (file, image,
	document) we show a blank id when the item is first created.

	this version of Xopus swallows the first paragraph of your text in

	* FactoryTool.py, FormTool.py, NavigationTool.py: * Fixed arguments
	to __call__ in FormTool.FormValidator -- this should fix an
	exception that was thrown in CMFBackTalk * FormValidator now grabs
	an id and a title from the object it ends up publishing, making its
	presence less visible to Breadcrumbs.py * Changed the syntax of the
	navigation properties (the old syntax still works, though).  You
	can now explicitly specify whether or not you want a redirect to
	occur.	Navigation options are now:
	
	redirect:action:XXX noredirect:action:XXX redirect:url:XXX
	noredirect:url:XXX redirect:script:XXX noredirect:script:XXX
	
	When there is no explicit redirect/noredirect, action and url
	default to redirect and script defaults to noredirect.'
	
	Note: noredirect:action appears to hit a bug in traversal in 2.5.1
	when the action contains 'portal_form'.  I think everything will
	work in 2.6 but I have _not_ tested it.  There might be some
	weirdness with nested portal_forms in URLs.

	* skins/plone_scripts/prepare_slots.py: weed out empty lines

2002-10-08 02:09  runyaga

	* skins/plone_scripts/prepare_slots.py: attempt to prepare the
	slots for a context.  the idea is to gain some flexibile and take
	out some extra logic that is currently in main_template.  what this
	does is return a mapping that we can easily tell whether or not we
	want to either: use-macro or render path expression.
	
	When using this we can more easily implement ram caching, since it
	doesnt work w/ macro slots.  ;'(
	
	so the code in main_template is very simple <td class="left">  
	<metal:block tal:repeat="slot slots_mapping/left">     <tal:block
	tal:condition="python:slot[1]">      <metal:block
	metal:use-macro="python:path(slot[0])" />     </tal:block>    
	<tal:block tal:condition="python:not slot[1]">	    <metal:block
	tal:replace="python:path(slot[0])" />	  </tal:block>	
	</metal:block> </td>
	
	and for the class="right" do the same thing but say
	slots_mapping/right

	* PloneFolder.py, Portal.py, __init__.py: Made some minor
	modifications that where blocking me from writing unittests from
	Plone. When creating a Plone Site from a unittest, we dont have a
	useable security context, so its not reliable to call invokeFactory
	there. I dont know if theres any other magic involved in the
	calling of invokeFactory, so if someone is reading this, feel free
	to blame me if anything goes wrong :).

	* skins/plone_forms/viewThreadsAtBottom.pt: Added a check to make
	the it play more nicely when just included, not called as a macro.
	This should make CMF products less prone to breakage when they
	don't use the regular discussion machinery.

2002-09-30 08:42  magnusheino

	* skins/plone_templates/header.pt: Make all names clickable.
	
	Without this, here is no way to get back to the parent folder when
	viewing a item inside of it.
	
	Example:
	
	http://site.com/Members/magnus/MyPhotos/foo.jpg/view
	
	If you go to that url, here is no link back to MyPhotos. Until now.

2002-09-30 08:17  magnusheino

	breadcrumbs has some short circuit code in it

2002-09-11 02:43  zopezen

	* skins/plone_forms/: discussion_reply_preview.pt,
	viewThreadsAtBottom.pt: Im probably breaking discussion here but
	hey thats why we have cvs. So someone can back out all these
	changes tommorrow...
	
	discussionitem_view does not need to do any testing on the view,
	that is all done in discussionView macro. For some reason if by
	changing the way this is called template.getId() in the
	discussionView is now read correctly. I need to read up more on how
	this works.
	
	viewThreadsAtBottom needs to have the isDiscussionAllowed and
	isViewTemplate in a separate check, to allow the previous call as
	far as i can tell. Now template.getId() works and the
	isDiscussionAllowed and isViewTemplate check passes.
	
	There are still things I dont like about the discussion interface,
	but i want to make sure im on the right track first...

	plone_forms/search_form.pt, plone_templates/header.pt,
	plone_templates/main_template.pt: Make all i18n tags compatible
	with the Zope 2.7 implementation.
	
	The Zope 2.7 implementation is more restrictive that AltPTi18n, in
	that (for internal implementation reasons) it can't have a
	tal:replace and a i18n:translate on the same tag. This means that
	constructions like:
	
	 <span tal:replace="foo/bar" i18n:translate="">Foobar</span>
	
	have to be replaced by the more verbose:
	
	 <span tal:omit-tag="" i18n:translate=""><span
	tal:replace="foo/bar">Foobar</span></span>
	
	This basically corresponds to computed message ids. There are not
	many such occurences in Plone so it's not a big problem to use the
	verbose form.

	Added a hook for PloneFolders for manage_afterAdd() this hook works
	exceedingly well for TTW objects.  If you need to "post-init" a
	Folder create a method called "doAfterCreation" which is checked on
	the object after its created.  if it exists its executes.

	* skins/plone_templates/portal_boxes.pt: 
	now if you are member you will always get the Navigation box..
	yeehaw! we should not have documentation that basically explains

	plone_templates/content_template.pt, plone_templates/header.pt: 
	added full paths to stylesheets as well as RESPONSE headers so they
	would cache.  this appears to have sped up access time in IE6.0
	significantly.	since all CSS's are cached, external JS, and images
	in the CSSValues are now fully qualified.
	
	also added allowAnonymousViewAbout properties to Install/Update
	this is so admins can toggle if they want to show About boxes to
	anonymous.  I believe we can merge portal_template and
	content_template now.
