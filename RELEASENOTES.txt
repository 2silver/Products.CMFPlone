Plone 3.5 - TBD
===============

The following is a list of important things to note when installing or
upgrading to Plone 3.5:

* Unpacking the Plone archive with WinZip will not work: WinZip will truncate
  filenames without warning you. 7-Zip is a good open source alternative for
  Windows that you can use instead: http://www.7-zip.org

* Zope 2.11.0+ is now required. Older versions of Zope will not work. Zope
  2.12 and later may or may not work. Zope 3.x is not supported.

* The python ElementTree package is now required. This package can be
  downloaded from its home page at http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree .

* The python lxml package is now required to run all tests. It is
  not needed for normal Plone use. This package can be downloaded
  from its home page at http://codespeak.net/lxml/ .

* The Python OpenID packages are required if you want to enable OpenID support.
  They can be downloaded from the OpenID enabled site at
  http://www.openidenabled.com/resources/downloads/python-openid/

* Plone 3.5 uses both Zope Products and python packages. The Zope Products
  are installed in the usual location: the Products directory of the Zope
  instance. Python package may be installed in the lib/python directory in the
  Zope instance, or anywhere on the standard python path.

Preferred but not obligatory (right now)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use events instead of manage_ methods (which will probably disappear in Plone
  4.0 or 4.5)

* Packaging technology:

  - Use python packages instead of Zope products. Creating python packages
    is very easy using the paster tool. See
    http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/use-paster/ for more information.

  - Use ploneit or ploneout to create development and/or production
    environments

  - Releasing packages as eggs and registering them with the Python Cheese
    Shop (http://cheeseshop.python.org/) makes it simple for people to
    install them and all required dependencies if they are using a system
    such as ploneout, ploneit or workingenv.
