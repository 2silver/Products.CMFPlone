Plone 3.0 - May, 2007
=====================

The following is a list of important things to note when installing or
upgrading to Plone 3.0:

* Zope 2.10.3+ is now required. Older versions of Zope will not work. Zope 2.11
  and later may or may not work.

* The python ElementTree package is now required. This package can be
  downloaded from its homepage at http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree .

* The python lxml package is now required to run all tests. It is
  not needed for normal Plone users. This package can be downloaded
  from its homepage at http://codespeak.net/lxml/ .

* Plone 3.0 uses both Zope Products and python packages. The Zope Products
 are installed in the usual location: the Products directory of the Zope
 instance. Python package may be installed in the lib/python directory in the
 Zope instance, or anywhere on the standard python path.

* The GroupUserFolder user folder is no longer supported; instead Plone
  now requires the Pluggable Authentication System (PAS). It may not be
  possible to upgrade a site using GRUF with external user folders such as
  LDAPUserFolder. In those cases it is advised to create a new site and move
  the content over manually.


Plone 3.0 is still in development
---------------------------------

Plone 3.0 is not finished yet. Some important things to take into account:

* Migration from older sites is not working correctly in Plone 3.0-beta1. This
  will be fixed in beta2.

* the kss related ids and classes are subject to change. They will be fixed in
  beta2.

* the release notes and upgrade instructions are not completed yet.


Important notes for users
-------------------------

* The most significant new feature is undoubtedly KSS - Kinetic Style
  Sheets - or, Plone's Ajax framework. This allows Plone to have a more
  polished user interface elements and more powerful dynamic applications that
  can refresh data in a page without having to reload the entire page. For
  example, you can double-click the title of the page to instantly edit it. Or
  switch between tabs nearly instantly. Or validate form fields before you hit
  submit. And that's just the beginning.

* Plone 3.0 now provides document versioning out of the box. Versioning allows
  you to save old versions of a page, compare your current version to older
  versions, and even to roll back to previous versions. Plone 3.0 also includes
  document staging, the ability to work on a copy of a document while the old
  version is still live.  Finally, Plone 3.0 includes locking, which prevents
  two people from making changes to a document at the same time. Together,
  versioning, staging and locking will make Plone 3.0 very appealing to folks
  who are managing sophisticated sites with multiple people editing content at
  the same time.

* A link integrity feature has been added which can automatically
  detect and prevent broken links in a site, or intelligently redirect users if
  they use a broken link into a site. Plone will now:

  - warn you when you try to delete a page that has incoming links from
    elsewhere on your site

  - automatically create redirects when you move or rename a page that has
    incoming links

* Portlets have been greatly enhanced. There is a new 'manage portlets' option
  available in the site which allows you to

  - instantly add, remove and reorder portlets

  - control whether portlets get inherited from parent folders

  - customize portlets per-user, per-group and per content type

  - control the number of items in listing portlets

* Plone now supports the Google Sitemap protocol, described in 
  https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/docs/en/protocol.html

  It is enabled by default and the sitemap.xml.gz file is provided in the root
  of your portal.

  You can switch the sitemap feature off under Site Settings in the Site Setup
  page.

* The Plone Tableless skin has been removed. The standard Plone skin makes
  very minimal use of tables and can be flexibly styled, as is demonstrated
  by the NuPlone theme.

* KSS/Azax
* new workflows
* wicked
* versioning, staging and locking
* content rules
* S5


Important notes for system administrators
-----------------------------------------

For migration instructions please see http://plone.org/documentation/<nog even opzoeken>

* Caching related changes required (or maybe none!)




Important notes for developers
------------------------------

* getToolByName has been deprectaed in favour of getUtility, queryUtility and
  getUtilityByName. Please see http://svn.zope.org/CMF/trunk/docs/ToolsAreUtilities.stx
  for more information on this change.

* Searching for users and groups using the portal_membership and portal_groups
  tools has been deprectaed. Please use the search features of PAS directly
  or the PlonePAS pas_search browser view.

* portlets have been re-implemented using the Zope3 component architecture.
  -> Martin Aspeli to fill in stuff here

* Skins: main_template now uses viewlet managers instead of metal macros
  -> Alexander Limi or Cornelis to fill in stuff here

* workflows must he implemented via GenericSetup profiles now

* CMF 2.1 instead of CMF 1.x:
   - Products.CMFCore.CMFPermissions is now called Products.CMFCore.permissions

* You can use the contentmigration product to write migrations for your own products
  -> this should be a seperate tutorial on plone.org !

Preferred but not obligatory (right now):

* use the python logging module instead of zLOG

* QuickInstaller-based installation should use GenericSetup profiles instead 

* use events instead of manage_ methods (which will probably disappear in plone 3.5 or 4.0)

* Packaging technology:
  - Use python packages instead of Zope products

  - Ship packages as eggs and register in the cheeseshop

  - Use paste to create new packages

  - Use ploneit or ploneout to create development and/or production environments
