Plon 3.0 - May, 2007
====================

The following is a list of important things to note when installing or upgrading
to Plone 3.0:

* Zope 2.10.2+ is now required. Older versions of Zope will not work. Zope 2.11
and later may or may not work.

* The python ElementTree package is now required. This package can be
downloaded from its homepage at http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree .

* Plone 3.0 uses both Zope Products and python packages. The Zope Products
are installed in the usual location: the Products directory of the Zope
instance. Python package may be installed in the lib/python directory in
the Zope instance, or anywhere on the standard python path.

* The GroupUserFolder user folder is no longer supported; instead Plone
now requires the Pluggable Authentication System (PAS). It may not be
possible to upgrade a site using GRUF with external user folders such
as LDAPUserFolder. In those cases it is advised to create a new site and
move the content over manually.
