Plone 4.0 - TBD
===============

The following is a list of important things to note when installing or
upgrading to Plone 4.0:

* Unpacking the Plone archive with WinZip will not work: WinZip will truncate
  filenames without warning you. 7-Zip is a good open source alternative for
  Windows that you can use instead: http://www.7-zip.org

* Zope 2.11.0+ is now required. Older versions of Zope will not work. Zope
  2.12 and later may or may not work. Zope 3.x is not supported.

* The python-gettext package is now required. This package can be
  downloaded from its home page at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gettext .

* The python ElementTree package is now required. This package can be
  downloaded from its home page at http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree .

* The python lxml package is now required to run all tests. It is
  not needed for normal Plone use. This package can be downloaded
  from its home page at http://codespeak.net/lxml/ .

* The Python OpenID packages are required if you want to enable OpenID support.
  They can be downloaded from the OpenID enabled site at
  http://www.openidenabled.com/resources/downloads/python-openid/

* Plone 4.0 uses both Zope Products and python packages. The Zope Products
  are installed in the usual location: the Products directory of the Zope
  instance. Python package may be installed in the lib/python directory in the
  Zope instance, or anywhere on the standard python path.


Important notes for users
-------------------------

* None so far.


Important notes for site and system administrators
--------------------------------------------------

For migration instructions please see the online Plone upgrade manual:
http://plone.org/upgrade

* The way in which PlacelessTranslationService handles translation files (*.po)
  has significantly changed. The mo file cache found in INSTANCE_HOME/var/pts
  does no longer exist and will be deleted when found. Instead po files will be
  compiled to mo files inside the products i18n folders as it already happened
  for po files inside locales folders. This means the (Unix/Windows/...) user
  running the Zope process needs to have write access to all Products folder at
  least once and whenever changes where done to the po files. Inside the ZMI
  the Control_Panel entry for PlacelessTranslationService does no longer exist.
  In order to reload message catalog the Zope process has to be restarted.
  Internally all po files are registered directly as ITranslationDomain
  utilities and will be handled by the Zope3/Five translation service.

Important notes for developers

Preferred but not obligatory (right now)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Packaging technology:

  - Use python packages instead of Zope products. Creating python packages
    is very easy using the paster tool. See
    http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/use-paster/ for more information.

  - Use ploneout to create development and/or production environments.

  - Releasing packages as eggs and registering them with the Python Package
    Index (http://pypi.python.org/) makes it simple for people to
    install them and all required dependencies if they are using a system
    such as ploneout.
