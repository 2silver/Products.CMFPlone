#This document was taken from the plone-developers mailing list
#it was originally created by Kevin McKeown to more thoroughly
#explain how-to migrate using the Migration machinery.

1. Make sure you have backed up of your Zope var/Data.fs !

2. In the folder containing the Plone site folder to be migrated create
an External Method called migrate_folders with the following properties:

Id: migrate_folders
Title: Migrate Folders (optional)
Module Name: CMFPlone.migration
Function Name: migrate_portal

For example, if your Plone site is in the Root Folder (/PloneSite) then
create the migrate_folders method in the Root Folder.

3. In the same folder as the migrate_folders method, create a Script
(Python) called gogo_migrate. Edit the script so it appears thus:

context.migrate_folders('PloneSite')
return 'fin'

where PloneSite is the Id of the Plone site you want to migrate. (Don't
forget the ''). Save the script.

3. Run the gogo_migrate script by opening the script and clicking on the
'Test' tab. 

4. When the script has completed you should see the word 'fin' on the
main Zope Management Interface screen. You will now find two copies of
your Plone site:
PloneSite - this is the *new* migrated site
tmp_PloneSite - a copy of the original site

5. You have now migrated your Plone site!
