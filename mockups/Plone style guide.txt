                         Plone style guide


o use the term "item" to refer to an object

o use the term "save" to submit a form that changes the content of an object

o always include cancel buttons

o always do Capitalization (Proper Casing) on buttons etc - Plone will transform the text via CSS
  where required

o forms should never be content_template type, When you're in a form, you don't want the edit/view/info buttons to confuse the user

o All pages should have a title, and a small explanation. To exemplify, the content_retract_form should have the publishing description listed right below the title, not in the form itself.

o Plone has two types of buttons

  o White means "this button will do action depending on data youentered/items you have checked"
    Examples: Standard submit buttons, the rename/copy/delete buttons
    Name: "context"

  o Blue button means "go to a page where you can alter stuff"
    Examples: Local Role button - this brings up a new page where you can enter info and save it.
              The save button in itself is white, as it does an action based on entered data.
    Name: "standalone"

o Standard Plone forms have input widget width="25" to work nicely in low resolutions

Howto make your Product Plone-compliant in 1-2-3:

o add class="context" and class="standalone" to your buttons (see explanation of difference above)


Other:
o Remember to indent properly! Tabs are set to 4 spaces, not the tab symbol.


Suggested folder structure:

- scripts
- edit forms
- content templates
- repeated elements (header, footer etc)

- images
- CSS
