<p class="discreet">
If you're seeing this instead of the web site you were expecting, the owner of
this web site has just installed Plone. Do not contact the Plone Team 
or the Plone mailing lists about this.
</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>

<p>
Before you start exploring your newly created Plone site, please do the following:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure you are logged in as an admin/manager user 
        <span class="discreet">(you should see a Site Setup link in the top right corner)</span></li>
    <li><a href="@@mail-controlpanel">Set up your mail server</a> <span class="discreet">(Plone needs a valid SMTP server to verify users and send out password reminders)</span></li>
    <li><a href="@@security-controlpanel">Decide what security level you want on your site</a> <span class="discreet">(who can join, password policies, etc)</span></li>
</ol>

<p>After that, we suggest you do one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Find out <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/whatsnew/3.0">What's new in Plone 3.0</a></li>
    <li>Read the <a href="http://plone.org/documentation">documentation</a>, especially the 
        <a href="http://plone.org/documentation/how-to/read-documentation">What documentation should I read</a>

    <li>Read and/or subscribe to the <a href="http://plone.org/support">support forums</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Make it your own</h2>

Plone has a lot of different settings, so experiment and make it behave like you want it to.

<ul>
    <li>
    By default, Plone uses a visual editor for content, but if you prefer 
    text-based syntax and/or wiki syntax, you can change this in the
    <a href="@@markup-controlpanel">markup control panel</a>
    </li>

    <li>
    Try out a different theme, either pick from 
    <a href="@@skins-controlpanel">the included ones</a>, or one of the 
    <a href="http://plone.org/products/by-category/themes">available 
    themes from plone.org</a>
    </li>

    <li>&hellip;and many more settings are available in the <a href="plone_control_panel">Site Setup</a>
    
</ul>
