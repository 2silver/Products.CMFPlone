How to upgrade a Plone site to a newer version

1. Stop Plone

2. Backup your Plone site, just in case. You should backup:

    - your Data.fs which contains your site data
    - any file system files in which you have modified
    
3. Install the new version of Plone, this depends upon your installation. Newest versions of Plone are always available from http://plone.org/downloads and your install will depend upon your particular setup. Generally you should unpack the CMFPlone folder over your existing one.

4. Restart Plone

5. For each Plone site enter the ZMI and go to portal_migrations and click on the migrate tab. Click the migrate button to migrate your instance to the version you have just downloaded.

Running a migration may:

- change values you have set in the ZODB such as actions, properties skins and such

- mean a recataloguing of your portal_catalog, this may be time consuming

- reapplying security to objects, this may be time consuming

If you have issues please try one of the mailing lists including: your Zope, CMF and Python versions, the platform and the CMFPlone versions you are migrating to and from. The mailing lists can be found at http://plone.org
